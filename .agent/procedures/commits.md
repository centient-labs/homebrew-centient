# Commit Procedures

## Commit Format

Use conventional commits:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Subject line is all lowercase.** Acronyms like UI/UX, API, ADR must be
written lowercase (`ui/ux`, `api`, `adr`). Commitlint rejects uppercase
subjects.

### Types

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | New feature or functionality |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes nor adds |
| `chore` | Build, CI, dependencies, configs |

### Scopes

Define them in `commits-local.md` (the repo-specific sibling loaded alongside
this file). Common patterns: monorepo package names, module names, or omit the
scope for single-package repos.

## Pre-commit Checklist

- [ ] Files staged (`git add <files>`)
- [ ] Lint passes (`make lint` or toolchain equivalent)
- [ ] Tests pass (`make test`)
- [ ] No secrets in diff (`git diff --staged | grep -iE "api_key|password|secret|token"`)
- [ ] Commit message follows format
- [ ] Co-Author line included

## Branch Workflow

1. Create feature branch from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/description
   ```
2. Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
3. Push and open a PR:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feat/description
   gh pr create --base main
   ```
4. The maintainer bot (or a human reviewer) approves and merges via squash.

**Never push directly to `main`.** Branch protection enforces PR-only workflow
on Tier A repos; even where it doesn't, treat direct-to-main as prohibited.

**Prefer independent PRs — do not stack.** Branch **every** PR off `main`. If a PR
references another unmerged PR, still branch off `main` and note the dependency in
the PR body — doc cross-references resolve once both land; do not branch one PR off
another. Stack **only** for a true *content* dependency (your code cannot build or
test without the other PR's code). When you must stack: the base merges first, then
**rebase the child onto `main`** before merging it, and **never squash-merge or
force-push a PR whose head is the base of an open child** — it rewrites the base's
SHAs and strands the child, which is how a "merged" stacked PR can land its content
on a dead branch instead of `main`.

## Anti-patterns

```bash
# BAD — vague message
git commit -m "updates"

# BAD — uppercase subject
git commit -m "Fix: resolve bug"

# BAD — mixed changes
git commit -m "feat: add feature and fix bug and update docs"

# GOOD — specific, lowercase, single concern
git commit -m "feat(search): add semantic ranking to query results"
```
